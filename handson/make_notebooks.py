"""Generate the Hands-on 1 notebooks.

Single source of truth for both the student notebook and the solutions
notebook. Cells are declared once, below, in reading order:

    M(text)             a markdown cell, identical in both
    C(code)             a code cell, identical in both (given to students)
    S(solution, stub)   a code cell that differs: students get `stub`

Run this file to write handson/H1_gaussian_field.ipynb and
handson/H1_gaussian_field_solutions.ipynb. Never edit the .ipynb by hand.
